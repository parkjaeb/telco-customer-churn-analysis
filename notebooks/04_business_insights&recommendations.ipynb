    "\n",
    "- Encourage Long-Term Contracts \n",
    "Customers on month-to-month plans churn at a much higher rate. Promote annual or 2-year contracts with loyalty discounts to reduce churn.\n",

    "- Bundle Value-Added Services\n",

    "- Investigate Fiber Optic Experience\n",
    "Fiber users churn more - possibly due to reliability issues. Conduct user interviews or NPS surveys to find the foot cause."
